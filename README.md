Bro Legends is an iOS application that aims to help the community of League of Legends, that tries to make players get better with their abilities by finding duo to play with them.
Find the best player to do duo with you based not only on Elo, but also by a filter of lanes, so will only be displayed to the user, players that meet your duo need, causing you to play only with the lanes you like the best and play with partners that complement your gameplay. We get information about one player and display to the other, if both players like each other, they will have a match, so their name will be displayed one another and them they can go and play League of Legends matches together.
With this, we use information obtained through the Summoner-V3, League-V3, Match-V3 APIs and the static information provided by the DataDragon API to get all the information necessary to make the interface simple, enjoyable and intuitive.
